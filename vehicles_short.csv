In 2014 I had a tie rod break after hitting a big pothole and it the threw car into a ditch. Damage was to the pass fender / rocker and door/ a arm and tie rod but it was enough to total the car. Seeing that the damage was minimal I bought the car back from Insurance and built it into what you see here with oem parts . I worked for a body shop at the time and everything was done professionally and with care. Body & Frame was checked straightness before any work was done and all body work done in house professionally by a local body shop . I have never re-registered the car bc I have a Dealer plate to drive it on and didn?€?t see the need .   To register this car It will need to be inspected so check your state dmv laws.I have all forms and info to get it through CT Inspection.  I also have a ton of parts and  have a Clean 2000 mustang GT Title and vin that will be included w/ the purchase from a doner car that I scrapped comes with vin check and both Vin Sticker and plate if you want to go that route .    I have put many miles on the car over the years since it was rebuilt back in 2014.This car is a blast to drive and would be awesome on a track or road course.  It drives perfectly and straight w/ no issue and is a blast to drive. Parts on this car alone exceed over 20k .   After a tough decision It is time to sell and move on. Please Contact me w/ any questions, and yes it is as nice as it looks in the pictures.   I would also be interested in trade for :  2nd gen F150 lightning or a 2005 and up mustang GT. Other Trades I would consider would be a 2005 and up Pontoon or fast boat . Coyote swapped mustangs or Polaris RZR .   203 nine eight 2- 8 nine six six   I also have a ton of stock/ aftermarket parts which will go with car such as hood , rear decklid , seats and headlights to name a few .",,ct,41.5817,-73.4128

Source: Edmunds * Driving the 2014 Ford Focus is incredibly fun and enjoyable. It has a dynamic design, addictive driving experience, and an interior that immerses you into something that is definitely more than just a car. The Focus comes in 7 models to pick from: the Base S Sedan, SE Sedan, SE Hatch, Titanium Sedan, ST, Titanium Hatch, and Electric. New for 2014, there's a Sport Appearance Package for the SE, which has sport cloth seats, a leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift knob, and an available rear spoiler. Every drop of fuel is effectively used in the Focus with its 2.0L engine. Twin independent variable camshaft timing adds extra precision, contributing to fuel efficiency or power output. The electric power-assisted steering contributes to fuel efficiency as well. Plus, Active Grille Shutters help Focus make itself even more aerodynamic and fuel-efficient. This all helps Focus SE with the SFE Package achieve up to 40 MPG HWY, which equals less stops at the pump. For entertainment, there's SYNC with MyFord Touch, standard on Titanium and Electric trims, and optional on SE and ST. On select models, luxury comes in the form of leather-trimmed seats, dual-zone electronic automatic temperature control, ambient lighting, and 2 Interior Style Packages that feature two-tone leather-trimmed seats, matching door-trim inserts, coordinated steering wheel trim and more. The new Focus ST is geared to get you to your destination quickly. Mash the aluminum accelerator pedal and you'll be treated to the rollicking performance of its 252hp, 2.0L EcoBoost engine that's linked to a 6-speed manual transmission. An overboost feature can sustain increased torque (from 3000 to 4500 rpm) for 15 seconds at a time enhancing its performance feel.

It is an automatic, 2WD unit.   This truck is all original and has never been chipped or modified.  It has the factory camper package of 2002.   I am the 2nd owner for the past 16 years, with a clean Car fax.  It is dark gray.  The clear coat is sun fading on hood and top giving the truck the ""patina"" look..  The truck's body does not have any damages; this includes door dings!  It has cloth buckets in gray color as well.   The interior looks like it just came off the showroom.   It is short bed with bed liner.   Alloy wheels with load rated tires.   This truck has been babied- never really pulling a trailer although I installed a trailer brake controller.   It has an after market alarm system.  The 7.3L diesel runs excellent as it should with such low mileage.   This motor will run in excess of 500K miles- this truck is not broken in yet.  If you are still reading this you know what I am talking about- this will run on virtually any oil fuel- bio-diesel, cooking oils, etc.   It does not need the exhaust additive the newer diesel require.  It has a front bull bar and all power features the XLT models has as standard.   Call/text me is the best method for contacting me to discuss this one of a kind find!  Use Craigslist email; will not e-mail Gmail accounts.  There are no other 7.3L on CL with this low mileage.  If ad is up, then vehicle is still available.  $15750.00    show contact info",,nm,35.1506,-106.569

Likely you have been to several car lots with that very slogan, however, you don't get approved! The difference is we make the approval happen. The reason for our rate of success in approving loans is that we have finance managers that have actually worked for banks and have connections most independent car dealers do not. With that being said, there are a couple requirements the customers must meet such as income, valid driver license and all information provided to the dealership must be accurate (such as job time, residency, etc).

It should go without saying it was in an accident, cosmetic only, previous owner backed his truck into it. Door seals perfect, the frame and pillar are fine. Windows and door locks work perfectly if you don't care to replace, they're cheap at the junk yard if you do. 100$-200$ for doors at junk yard. Timing belt and water pump were done on 12/21/19 at 167,xxx miles. Tires have less than 10k miles on them, they were replaced right before the timing belt and pump. Tested alternator, it is not causing issues currently, but is running weak and will need to be replaced relatively soon. 200$-300$ max to fix. If you want a great deal, and don't see these as real issues, message me about your vehicle. Having said all that it is an excellent ride, has impressive acceleration, heated leather seats, navigation, panoramic moonroof and AWD.",,va,39.1858,-78.1827

Likely you have been to several car lots with that very slogan, however, you don't get approved! The difference is we make the approval happen. The reason for our rate of success in approving loans is that we have finance managers that have actually worked for banks and have connections most independent car dealers do not. With that being said, there are a couple requirements the customers must meet such as income, valid driver license and all information provided to the dealership must be accurate (such as job time, residency, etc).

Priced for quick sale/profit  I have been the 2nd owner of this car, since 2008, and it was driving just fine until last week. 1 week ago, the oil pan cracked due to a pothole. While the car is sitting in my driveway, due to the recent torrential rain, the back seat and trunk got flooded. I have wet-vacuumed out as much water as possible, but I am not interested in towing or spending $400 to repair the oil pan.   If you are handy or want to spend a small amount of money, you can fix 'er up and have a running vehicle for cheap. Engine and transmission runs smooth, 200k miles and many more to go (thanks to German engineering). The tires and wheels are in good shape, many components recently replaced including struts/springs, starter, ignition coil, O2 sensor, rear brakes, etc. All repair records available (car was serviced at Eurowerks in Falls Church).

We purchased it directly from Fitzgerald Toyota in Germantown. It is a darker blue color, close to navy blue and has light grey leather on inside. For the first couple of years, I used it to drive to work during the week and the kids were in it over the weekend. We had an au pair transport the kids in a smaller car during the week. During the the last couple of years, my husband has used it to drop our now 16-year-old daughter and 10-year-old son off at school in the morning and go to work. I've used our other car to pick them up and drive them home.   This Limited edition is the highest model of the Toyota Sienna, providing the most options. It is a 5-door, 7-passenger minivan. There are two captain's chairs in the middle and a full bench seat in the back. The third and fourth passenger doors are powered can be closed either by passengers in the back or by the driver/passenger in the front via a center console. There is also privacy glass and power windows, plus a dual sunroof! The windows in the back have shades the can be manually lifted up or down to provide shade for back-seat passengers, whether it be babies, kids, or teens.   The exterior of the car on the powered trunk lift gate has a rear spoiler, underneath that hides your rear windshield wiper keeping it out-of-sight until needed. The tires have aluminum wheels, and two tires were just replaced about 4 weeks ago, due to us running over nails in a construction site! The MPG is 16 City/ 22 Hwy and All-Wheel Drive with a 6-speed shiftable Automatic Transmission. Range in miles on one tank of gas is 320/440 mi. and the Sienna can hold 20 gallons of gas. The base engine size is 3.5 Liters with 266 horsepower @ 6200 rpm and DOHC (double overhead cams).  In terms of safety, included our minivan has: passenger head whiplash protection system; rear door child safety locks; front and rear parking sensors; rearview camera; turn signal mirrors; daytime running lights; engine immobilizer; dual front-side airbags; stability control; passenger airbag occupant sensing deactivation; rear height adjustable headrests; remote anti-theft alarm system; 2 front headrests; 2 rear headrests; auto delay off headlamps; tire pressure monitoring; traction control; front, side, and third row head airbags; front fog/driving lights; post-collision safety system; child seat anchors; emergency braking; ventilated front disc and solid rear disc brakes.  For In-Car Entertainment, our van has: JBL Premium Brand Stereo System w/ JBL Premium Speakers; Element Antenna; AM/FM Stereo; Speed Sensitive Volume Control; Auxiliary Audio Input and USB w/ External Media Control; Satellite Radio available; 10 total speakers; USB connection  Also included (not including everything): audio, bluetooth calling, and cruise control on steering wheel; front, rear, and third row cupholders; three zone climate control; electrochromatic inside rearview mirror; electric power steering; front and rear reading lights; leather and wood simulated steering wheel and center console; navigation, overhead console with storage; cruise control; cargo area light; keyless ignition; 12V cargo area power outlet; tilt and telescoping steering wheel; universal remote transmitter for garage door; interior air filtration; power mirrors; 4 one-touch power windows; remote keyless power door locks; heated mirrors; and multi-level heated front seats  There is also gray carpet floor mats, 1 pair of infrared headphones, BLU logic handsfree system and the dual screen rear entertainment system. It is one screen that comes down from the ceiling of the van. Your kids can watch one movie, or they can watch two different movies at one time. The rearview mirror shows what direction you are traveling; and the dashboard also displays external temperature, trip computer, tachometer, low fuel warning, and clock. The driver seat is an 8-way power adjustable seat with lumbar support. The passenger seat is a 4-way power adjustable seat. The rear bench seat is foldable down into the bottom of the cargo area.

Source: Edmunds  * If you?€?re looking for a compact pickup with a solid gold reputation for durability and reliability, the short list of choices will likely land you in one of the many 2015 Toyota Tacoma models. Off-roaders will appreciate the new TRD Pro Series. Source: KBB.com  * Get ready to have some serious fun with the most adrenaline-inducing lineup of off-road vehicles ever unleashed, the 2015 Toyota Tacoma Pro. It has muscular curves and a rugged look, complimented by large bumpers, bulging fenders, and a big grille. The 2015 Tacoma starts the adventure with available 4WD, an electronically controlled transfer case, stability control sensors and available BFGoodrich off-road tires, to deliver maximum traction. Whether it is for work or play, the Tacoma can handle all you throw at it in a more manageable form than a full-size pickup. Offered in three cab: Regular Cab fits up to 3 people, the Access Cab seats 4, and the Double Cab with large four doors and spacious interior for 5. Each cab size can be purchased as a Rear-Wheel Drive, or with 4WDemand part-time 4WD that can switch from 2WD to 4WD and back even while the vehicle is in motion. Each drivetrain is available with an automatic or a manual transmission. The exception is the Double Cab 4x2s, which are automatics only. All Regular Cab trims are powered by a 2.7-Liter, 159 Horsepower, 4-Cylinder engine. The Access Cab and Double Cabs add an optional 4.0-Liter, 236 Horsepower V6, exclusive to certain trims. Its fiber-reinforced composite bed has better impact strength than steel. Everywhere you look, you'll find thoughtful additions like rails, rings and compartments that make loading/unloading super easy. The interior has a modern urban feel, with controls and instruments that are easy to see and use. Sit inside and appreciate its intuitive feel, that is easy to maintain and comfortable as well. Offered with four levels of Entune audio, which uses compatible smartphones to provide access to information, entertainment and navigation.

A 1.5-liter four-cylinder gasoline engine produces 73 horsepower and 82 pound-feet of torque, while a pair of electric motor/generators supplies an additional 60 hp. The gas engine acts as a main propulsion source as well as a generator to charge the nickel-metal hydride batteries. The electric motors also contribute to propulsion and charge the battery pack under deceleration. Combined power output comes to 99 hp and is sent to the front wheels via a continuously variable transmission (CVT).  Of course with any Prius, the most important numbers relate to fuel economy, and the Prius C does not disappoint. EPA-estimated mileage stands at 53 mpg city/46 mpg highway and 50 mpg in combined driving, making it the most economical non-plug-in hybrid on the market.  Safety Standard safety features on all 2013 Toyota Prius C models include stability control, traction control, antilock brakes (front discs, rear drums), hill start assist, front seat side airbags, side curtain airbags, a driver knee airbag and unique front seat cushion airbags that help prevent occupants from sliding under the seatbelts in the event of a collision. In Edmunds brake testing, a Prius C came to a stop from 60 mph in a better-than-average 118 feet.  Driving The Prius liftback has never been described as fun or engaging from behind the wheel, but the 2013 Toyota Prius C manages to liven things up. Its smaller footprint and more advantageous positioning of hybrid components allow for a bit more nimbleness, though it's still a far cry from conventional hatchbacks. Acceleration is comparatively slow, but power is perfectly acceptable for around-town driving and getting up to highway speeds.  As expected, fuel economy is outstanding. Outside of a plug-in hybrid, you're not going to do better than a Prius C. An unfortunate downside to the economy-focused mission, however, is a noticeable degradation in ride quality.   Interior Inside, the Prius C features a sleek, modern design with a mix of the familiar as well as the unconventional. Centrally located gauges are mounted high atop the dashboard, which can be a bit odd at first, but makes for easier reading.   The 2013 Toyota Prius C is powered by a similar but smaller hybrid powertrain than its bigger Prius siblings. A 1.5-liter four-cylinder gasoline engine produces 73 horsepower and 82 pound-feet of torque, while a pair of electric motor/generators supplies an additional 60 hp.

The electric motors also contribute to propulsion and charge the battery pack under deceleration. Combined power output comes to 99 hp and is sent to the front wheels via a continuously variable transmission (CVT).  This Prius C Three gets you navigation with a 6.1-inch touchscreen, keyless ignition/entry, satellite radio and voice control. Also included is Toyota's Entune smartphone integration system that adds Bing search functions, streaming Internet audio and traffic, sports and stock information with alloy wheels.",,mn,46.8907,-96.9258

Let's start with this vehicle is still on a loan. The asking price is the pay off amount.  I don't really want to sell. But I'm trying to go back to school. And it would be nice to be free of the debt load. Probably a long shot but anyway , if you've made it this far.  The car has had a lot done to it in the past two years. New front ball joints. New water pump and coolant hoses. New valve cover gasket and linkage seal. Both shops say the vehicle is in great condition. I have all the records from NW rally and SK Motorsports.  The only thing wrong with the car that I know off is that it needs a new right front bearing. Which will probably be done before it's sold. I also have an extra set of wheels , head lights and lug nuts to send with it.   I will give you the Carfax if your serious about buying.   Unfortunately I can't budge on the price since it's on a loan.  Contact if interested.  Thanks,  Madeline",,wa,48.9533,-122.128

Runs great. Great local commuter. It has a couple electrical issues. Ive diagnosed them and its few hundred dollar fix so I've been reluctant to do them. Windows will not roll down(happened all at once) so i use the ac and the sunroof when necessary. All the heat and ac works good.  The alarm I've avoided using because its difficult to turn off once engaged. Basically I don't lock the drivers door or roll down the windows. My diagnosis is that's all tied to the malfunctioning Comfort Control Module under the drivers side seat. For someone that knows older cars this is something fairly simple. Ive bought a new VW and I'm just to busy to deal with my older car.  The car has had thousands of dollars of work and added bluetooth wireless Pioneer stereo w/12 in sub and RF amp and 17 in rims and wheels. Stereo has lots of bass. I can remove the sub and amp if the customer doesn't want it. Ive honestly put well over a thousand dollars in the stereo. the wheels and rims were over 2000 bucks. So its a fun car and I've been attached to it for a long time.  It has a few cosmetic damages but nothing major. A couple scratches on the roof and dent over the right passenger side wheel.  Its a fun first car for someone and still looks good. Has tinted windows, nice wheels, and great stereo.",,wa,48.749,-122.489

Engine appears stock with exception of aluminum Edelbrock intake, water pump, and valve covers. Fresh tune-up and oil change. Mileage reads 34,000, but I suspect its higher than that.  New 2 1/2"" mandrel bent exhaust system with headers, with unique center exit stainless steel Magnaflow mufflers. Entire brake system rebuilt with new master cylinder, rear calipers and rotors, and stainless steel hard lines up front.  New Wilwood 6 piston calipers and slotted rotors up front.  Suspension rebuild consists of new SPC adjustable upper control arms and rebuilt factory lower control arms with DelAlum bushings.  New ball joints and wheel bearings. Suspension is Vansteel Advanced Street and Slalom system, with adustable QA1 shocks and composite rear monoleaf spring. The car handles and stops exceptionally well. Tires are 275/40/ZR18 Nitto NT555g2's on Team3/LT-III wheels. Everything listed above has less than 2500 miles on it. Interior is in good shape, and has black leather C6 corvette seats.  Tilt / telescopic steering column and removable rear window.  Original black leather buckets also come with car and are in good condition.  Rear bumper resembles pre '74 Corvette (with custom built aluminum spoiler and underbody diffuser), but the original bumper comes with car, along with original spare, rally wheels, and original suspension components.  Paint is decent, but has a few dings and scratches.  Very fun to drive.",,wa,48.8625,-122.595

He was known through Southern California for his show winning designs and custom car builds. He would always look for vehicles that were straight and rust free. Here had just begun building this panel in 2017 with the intention of entering it in the Oakland Roadster Show where he had won numerous awards.  Sadly in January of 2019 Tim passed away. I did not know him personally, but had seen his cars and his work. I had the opportunity to purchase this panel from his wife earlier this year with the intention of building it for a client. With the onset of Covid-19 those plans came to a halt.  As you look at the pictures, notice the custom, recessed firewall, and custom inner fenders. Also notice that the rear door handles have been removed and bear claw hinges with electric openers have been installed. Tim had envisioned installing a Chevy big block with a 4L60-E automatic transmission so the recessed firewall and new transmission tunnel. The all body panels have been fitted as well as the doors. Excellent door gaps etc. The doors have been modified for one-piece glass and I have new glass for the front doors and the original glass for the rear doors. There are several boxes of small parts.  The truck is straight enough for Black or any other color for that matter.  Tim had planned on installing a TCI IFS however it was stolen along with the engine, transmission and many boxes of new parts after he passed away. There is no engine, transmission, front suspension, wiring seat, front windshield, gauges or glove box door. Look at the pictures and feel free to ask reasonable questions.   I have been restoring and building antique and vintage cars and trucks professionally for over 40 years and I know that finding a G.M.C like this one that is arrow straight and 99.9% rust free is very difficult to do. There are no shortage of banged up, bondo filled, rust buckets out there for $4,000-$8,000 and up. I am going to offer it for sale, and if you are looking for a worthy project to build for yourself or your business, this would be an excellent choice.   In the event the you do not have the desire, skills or time, and would like to have it completed your way, then we can discuss that too. Anything you can dream up or imagine, I have either done it or can do it. Mild to Wild and anywhere in between. I will be open to discussing it with you. You can email me through Craigslist and provide your name and phone number and we can go from there.  Imagine how it will look with air ride all around and painted your favorite color. Suede anyone? New LT Supercharged Chevy? Straight 292 6 Cylinder? Oldsmobile Rocket?  If your are a capable and sincere person who would like to see a bit of what I am capable of, please visit. www.retrorodshop.com   If no one steps up and acquires it during the month of September, then as I complete other shop commitments I will be taking it apart and building it my way. Yes it may be for sale when I am done, however the price will increase dramatically.  There is an open and clean California Title.  My asking price is $12,000.00  Yes I will consider offers from serious, capable individuals. I may be open to part trades.   If you are reading this then it is still for sale.",,wa,48.8625,-122.595

I have a ?€?93 Subaru Impreza. I bought it when I first moved out here, because it is what I could afford but it?€?s probably better for parting out. I am not mechanically inclined to really determine anything about it though, but I want to be transparent that it is definitely not in great shape.  It had brake line issues, and I also believe transmission issues because of the kicks at certain miles. I live on a farm outside of county lines and need reliable transportation and something that can be counted on in the conditions I have to drive.  I am absolutely willing to negotiate on the price, as the car would probably have to be towed from our very inconvenient spot- plus the other issues. We have not ran it in a long time. We were able to drive it home from the mechanic and let it sit ever since. So, it WAS running, and I would be happy to try and give it a jump to confirm it continues to do so.  It has a clean title. Registration expired in July. I am at work, but can take any requested pictures of the vehicle for those who are interested.  Email first, and I will be happy to contact you through other means   Thanks",,wa,48.8001,-121.954
